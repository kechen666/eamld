# Test Suite Overview

Our comprehensive test framework validates two key aspects of the implementation:

## 1. Code Generation Verification
We rigorously test the correctness of:
- **BB (Bivariate Bicycle) code generation**
- **Surface code generation**

All generated codes are cross-verified against:
- The original specifications in their respective reference papers
- Theoretical expectations for code distance and stabilizer structure
- Known logical operator implementations

## 2. Contraction Engine Validation
For each contraction implementation, we verify:
- **Functional correctness**:
  - Final logical error rates match theoretical expectations
  - Syndrome processing produces mathematically valid results
  - Decoder outputs maintain code space consistency

- **Performance benchmarking**:
  - Decoding speed measurements under standardized conditions
  - Computational complexity scaling with code size
  - Memory usage patterns

The test suite includes:
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for full decoding pipelines
- Comparative benchmarks against reference implementations
- Stress tests for large-scale code instances

All tests are automated and run as part of our continuous integration pipeline to ensure ongoing correctness as the codebase evolves.
